# Description

This is a simple demonstration of HTML being used in conjuction with CSS.

- To run the simple website, you begin by opening a suitable browser (FireFox or Chrome) and type the destination file path of this repo (together with the hosts html file) in the address bar
- To ensure that the CSS file interacts with the HTML file, it must be in a subfolder of the main HTML file titled 'styles'
- The content is rudimentary, however its simplicity will allow for understanding and following HTML/CSS
- To experiment with styles, simple right click on the page(s) or any element of the page, and select 'inspect'
- To the right hand side of the screen, an HTML/CSS editing bar will open where it is possible to interact with modifying the styles/layout
